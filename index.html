                Sushi is a traditional Japanese dish that typically consists of vinegared rice combined with various ingredients such as seafood, vegetables, and occasionally tropical fruits. The most common seafood ingredients include raw or cooked fish like salmon, tuna, shrimp, and others. These ingredients are often served on small beds or rolls of rice and may be wrapped in seaweed (nori) or presented without it.

                <p>The term "hosomaki" translates to "thin roll" in English. This style of sushi consists of a small, cylindrical roll where the rice and filling are tightly wrapped with a sheet of seaweed (nori). The seaweed is usually on the outside, encasing the rice and ingredients.<br>
                    The filling in hosomaki typically includes one main ingredient, such as fish, vegetables, or pickles. Common examples of hosomaki fillings include tuna, cucumber, avocado, and pickled radish. Sometimes a small amount of wasabi is added for extra flavor.</p>

                <p>The term "uramaki" translates to "inside-out roll" in English. This is in contrast to traditional maki rolls, where the rice is on the inside and the seaweed wraps around the outside.<br>
                    The rice on the outside of uramaki rolls is often coated with sesame seeds, roe, or other ingredients to add flavor and texture. The seaweed is hidden inside the roll and is not immediately visible when the roll is served.</p>

                <p>Sashimi is a Japanese dish consisting of thinly sliced raw fish or seafood. Unlike sushi, which includes vinegared rice and may have various other ingredients, sashimi consists primarily of the raw seafood itself, often served with garnishes like shredded daikon radish, pickled ginger, and wasabi.</p>

                <p>Temaki is a style of sushi that is hand-rolled into a cone shape. The word "temaki" in Japanese translates to "hand-rolled" in English. These sushi cones are made by wrapping a sheet of seaweed (nori) around a cone-shaped bundle of rice and various fillings.<br>
                    The filling in temaki can vary widely and may include ingredients like fish, seafood, vegetables, and sometimes additional elements like avocado or spicy mayo. The seaweed cone is usually left open at the top, resembling an ice cream cone in shape.</p>
